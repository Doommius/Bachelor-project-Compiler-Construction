exp.zip contains all files.

----------

Run flex, bison, and compile by writing the following on the command line:

  make -f Makefile

To run, write the following on the command line:

  ./exp

Now you can type an expression ended by $ and <Ctrl>-D.
Example (leaving out the <Ctrl>-D):

  3*4-1/x$
